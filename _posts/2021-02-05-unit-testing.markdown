# What is unit testing?
Unit testing is the process of testing code to minimize any chances of miscalculations or unexpected errors. It helps with looking for expected outcomes from the code to match what the user may expect. One approach might be testing code by seperating it into the smallest possible piece of logic and testing it. This way we can find any errors that may arise due to small bits not working properly.

# What is test driven development?
Test driven development is a coding approach where the developer starts by first creating the test by defining the expected outcome of the function/code block before the function/code has been written. This allows the developer to write in a way that helps them discover what code they need to write next by allowing them to expect functions to perform/behave in the intended way.

# Why would you practice test driven development?
I would practice this apporach because it helps me know what I should do next. There are many times where I look at the code I have written and have forgottenw what my end goal even was. With unit testing, I can always be developing with a goal in mind. The code I write will also naturally be condensed and DRY since it will have been written with clear intent and to solve a problem.

# What are the advantages and disadvantages of test driven development?
One advantage may be writing code that focuses on microfeatures. This will not only increase your knowledge of the code you are writing but it will enhance the tests as they will be able to pick up errors that would have otheriwise been very hard to find.

Other advantages include: 
  - You only write code thatâ€™s needed.
  - Easier to maintain
  - Easier to refactor
  - Less debugging

One disadvantage is that it is time consuming. It may feel like an extra step that isn't necessarily required. Also, you need to know your code well as testing code you do not understand willl not help you suddenly figure it out.

Other disadvantages include: 
  - All the members of a team got to do it
  - Tests have to be maintained when requirements change
  
# What is a unit?
A unit is a the smallest piece of logical code that can be isolated and used for testing. It stripping the code down to its basic parts and testing to see if those work and then working up from there.
