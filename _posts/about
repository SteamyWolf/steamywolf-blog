Hi! My name is Wyatt Allan. I am from Santa Clarita, California. You may know the area from its theme park Magic Mountain. I am a developer currently attending UVU. I work at two companies currently: SecurityMetrics and Xenon. SecurityMetrics had me learn Angular over the summer of 2020 and it has been of great help. Xenon just barely found me through LinkedIn for my Angular experience so I should be of great help to them. Overall, I love coding and I'm so happy that it makes such logical sense. 

2020 has been quite the year for me. I got married in March right before the COVID hit hard. Now, my wife and I are building a house! So much has changed and I'm so exicted for the future.
