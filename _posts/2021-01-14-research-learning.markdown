### How do I personally research on the web?
I have realized that I am definitely a visual learner. When I get stuck on some concept with JavaScript or Angular or whatever language I am using, my first instinct is to search it right away in YouTube and watch a video of someone explaining the concept to me. Yet, lately, I have stopped myself from going onto YouTube. It takes too much time to sift through all the junk on there. I feel like I have a good grasp of all the concepts with the languages I use where now I tend to find more of my answers on StackOverflow. Now, I know that isn't always 100% reliable but it sure has gotten me out of some sticky situations.

### Tips and Tricks for searching the web
I always follow my question that I ahve typed into google with the language that I am using. This will narrow down my searches to what is relevant since a lot of the lingo may be used in various other languages. I also like to only type in keywords from the question and not too much fluff. 

I would also recommend MDN and even W3Schools. I know the latter if looked down upon but it still does have some good resources and examples for web dev. Especially for CSS! While MDN is comprehensive, it can be a bit hard to understand at times. This is where W3Schools shines since it is catered to basic understanding and easy to read language.

### Tutorial Hell
To me, Tutorial Hell is when you get so wrapped up in trying to learn code by passively watching youtube, or other videos nonstop. I've tried this and did it for so long and I became frustrated because when it came time to actually start writing something from scratch on a blank canvas, I froze. I didn't know what to do next. The tutorial junkies seemed to have it all figured out and it made me feel stupid. It wasn't until I forced myself to code and ask basic questions on google when I finally began coding on my own. It took getting out of my comfort zone and tutorials were my comfort zone for a long while. 

I would recommend to do them in the beginning to see how people code and only reference the video when you are absolutely stuck. But get use to now always having the answer right in front of you because that's. what the real world of coding is like. 

### How do I best learn development and JavaScript?

How does anyone get better at doing anything? PRACTICE! It is so obvious and such an ancient practice that I think we often overlook the true value of commiting oneself to a vocation and sticking with it through thick and thin. 

My internship over this past summer forced me to work harder at coding than I ever had. I came home some days feeling like a complete idiot! And I would add that there are still some days where I feel like that but it has become far less frequent than in the past. It is during the hard times of self-doubt where I feel most people quit.

To answer the question in more depth, I learn JavaScript and web developemnt in general by:
  - Watching vidoes on syntax and core explanations.
  - Writing a small application that uses the recently learned code.
  - I do it again but on a different application in a different way.
  - Move on with the application until I reach another problem or something new that I do not know the answet to.
  - Rinse and repeat.
  

### How would I recommend someone new to web developement learn the skill and why?
I did this just the other day with my brother-in-law David. He realized becoming a pilot wasn't the right choice for his career and family so I recommended he ty out web development. 
I sat him down and went through a quick coding example and basic knowledge of what to expect. He seemed interested. I also shared with him a Udemy course that he could use to learn how to build his own website from scratch to see if it was something he would be interested in. 
Since then, he has done a ton of research on web development and is now enrolled in Lambda Bootcamp since he already has his degree. I'm excited to see what he learns here shortly.

Be sure that I warned him of how hard it is and how even I don't feel like I know much even after being in it for almost 2 years. But he is a hard worker and I know he'll be motivated to stick with it.
