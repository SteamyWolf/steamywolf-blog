# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript adds strict typing features to JavaScript but it should not be seen as a plugin for JavaScript. It is it's own language, a superset of JavaScript meaning that you can still type all the JavaScript you want in it while extending the language to accept all JavaScript with the features of TypeScript. It allows the developer to assign types to Objects within the language. That way you can always know that your code is working properly.

# How does TypeScript help developers? Why is it a tool worth considering?
TypeScript allows the developer to understand the flow of their data by seeing the types change over the course of execution. By doing so, code is validated. You won't be left wondering how your string randomly became a number. TypeScript simply wouldn't allow it. It is also important to note that TypeScript can help define what your functions will be returning. With just a glance you can know what types of data your functions are giving you.

# What is the difference between compilation vs transpilation?
Both compilation and transpilation deal with taking source code and transfering it into another language. The difference is that transpilation takes the source code and transfers it to a similar language that has a similar level of abstraction. Abstraction in this case is refering to the level of complexity hidden from the user as a main component of programming in general.
