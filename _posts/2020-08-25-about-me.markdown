Hi! My name is Wyatt Allan and I am from Santa Clarita, California. You may know the area due to the theme park called Magic Mountain. I am the second oldest of 4 brothers and we all love to snowboard and dirt bike! 2020 has been quite the year for me. I got married, got my first developer job, and now my wife and I are building a house! 

I work at SecurityMetrics as an Angular Developer. I recently picked up another gig with a start-up called Xenon. They found me through LinkedIn so I know that updating and working with people through social media really works at building a network. Everything I have job related is due to networking.
