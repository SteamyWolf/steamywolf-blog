What is the JAMStack?
  - An easy way of putting it is a web site that does not require any web-server to be hosted. Instead it pre-renders the code and hooks up to a local CDN. This    CDN then hosts the site in a secure way. So no need to use back-end server side code to host static sites.
  
Why is it an important tool in web development?
  - It is important due to its ease of hosting with the added benefit of security. It bypasses the need for developers to depend on a web server. Servers are the target of hackers to displaying your site through a compiled CDN will make it safe and secure. Not to mention it is much cheaper and easier to use.
  
How can a web developer use the JAMStack?
  - JAMstack lives on Git so any developer can simply `git clone` and then run `npm install` to get the site hosted. A Developer also has the ability to use automatic deploys so that all the changes go live on a big site when the Developer has uploaded them all. 
  
What tools did you use to bring up your blog?
  - I used Jekyll from a Githhub server and cloned it onto my machine so that I could use it in my own repo hosted by Github pages. 
  
Why did you choose those tools?
  - It seemed like the easiest method to accomplish hosting a static site. I can see why people are interested in it due to how quick it can be updated and, in many cases, is user friendly.
